4.  Run "source config.sh"
5.  Enter "production" directory and run "source install_utils.sh"

BUILD CHANGES WHEN ALREADY IN PRODUCTION

* If you want to change some parameters of any of the containers, you can do it 2 ways:
1. you can go to container with "docker exec -it container_name bash" command and change your setting there and restart
   container afterwards for changes to take effect with "docker restart container_name"
2. you can modify "templates" directory and run "config.sh" script again, this will backup your old configs to "backup"
   directory and create new "production" dir and you can just restart any of your containers for changes to take effect...
   THIS STEP WILL NOT DELETE ANY OF YOUR DATA AS YOU ARE ONLY CHANGING THE WAY CONTAINERS ARE CREATED

LIVEAGENT VERSION UPDATE

*  download/move new version of LA .zip file to directory where version_update.sh is
*  run version_update.sh script - "source version_update.sh"
*  follow instructions from the script
